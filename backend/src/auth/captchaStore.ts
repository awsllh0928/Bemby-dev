// `atob` away and the captcha stopped anyone at all. What the client gets now is an opaque
// id that means nothing without this map.
//
// A challenge is also good for exactly one attempt. Left replayable, one solved challenge
// covered every guess made inside its five-minute life, so the only real brake on a
// password guess was the per-IP limiter.
